This is a project that I did in a few hours where there are two AI's; one knows a number (provided by the user) between 1-10,000 and the other does not.
The AI that does not know the number (AI 2) must guess using process of elimination.  After each incorrect guess AI 1 will inform AI 2 whether the number it seeks is higher or lower than the incorrect number it guessed.  This goes on until AI 2 has discovered the number and the program exits.
It is written entirely in python and recieves no command line arguments (didn't see much need of it)

Thanks for looking!
